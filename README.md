# IFL Project

This repository contains the code for Federated Learning (FL) experiments involving Differential Privacy (DP) methods. The code is written in Python using PyTorch and is designed for use in Google Colab or local Python environments.

## Files

- `IFL_main.py`: Main script for running the Federated Learning experiments with Differential Privacy.
- `IFL_main.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook version of the code.
- `VRIC.zip`: Dataset used in the experiments. This file is used to test the federated learning model.
- `results/`: Folder containing any results or output generated by the experiments (if applicable).

## Dependencies

The following Python packages are required to run the code:

- numpy
- matplotlib
- torch
- scikit-learn
- scipy
- torchvision

You can install all the dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
