# IFL Project

This repository contains the code for Federated Learning (FL) experiments involving Differential Privacy (DP) methods. The code is written in Python using PyTorch and is designed for use in Google Colab or local Python environments.

## Files

- `IFL_main.py`: Main script for running the Federated Learning experiments with Differential Privacy.
- `IFL_main.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook version of the code.
- `VRIC.zip`: Dataset used in the experiments. This file is used to test the federated learning model.
- `results/`: Folder containing any results or output generated by the experiments (if applicable).

## Dependencies

The following Python packages are required to run the code:

- numpy
- matplotlib
- torch
- scikit-learn
- scipy
- torchvision

You can install all the dependencies by running the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt


How to Run
1. Clone the repository to your local machine: https://github.com/Souvenir060/IFL_Project.git

2. Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the IFL_main.py script to start the experiment:
python IFL_main.py
Alternatively, you can open and run the IFL_main.ipynb notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is **VRIC.zip**. Due to its large size, it is not included in this repository. You can download it from the following link:

https://qmul-vric.github.io/index.html

Once downloaded, place the dataset in the `data/` directory.

Alternatively, you can use any similar dataset, and the code will work as long as you adjust the paths accordingly.

The code will automatically load the dataset and partition it for Federated Learning experiments.
