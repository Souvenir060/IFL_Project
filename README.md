# IFL Project

This repository contains the code for Federated Learning (FL) experiments involving Differential Privacy (DP) methods. The code is written in Python using PyTorch and is designed for use in Google Colab or local Python environments.

## Files

- `IFL_main.py`: Main script for running the Federated Learning experiments with Differential Privacy.
- `IFL_main.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook version of the code.
- `VRIC.zip`: Dataset used in the experiments. This file is used to test the federated learning model.
- `results/`: Folder containing any results or output generated by the experiments (if applicable).

## Dependencies

The following Python packages are required to run the code:

- numpy
- matplotlib
- torch
- scikit-learn
- scipy
- torchvision

You can install all the dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```bash

How to Run
```bash
Clone the repository to your local machine: https://github.com/Souvenir060/IFL_Project.git
```bash

Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```bash

Run the IFL_main.py script to start the experiment:
```bash
python IFL_main.py
```bash
Alternatively, you can open and run the IFL_main.ipynb notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.

Dataset
The dataset used for the experiments is VRIC.zip, which is located in the data/ folder. If you don't have the dataset, you can request it or use a similar dataset for your experiments.

Unzip the VRIC.zip file to the data/ folder.

The code will automatically load the dataset and partition it for Federated Learning experiments.

Results
This project generates evaluation metrics such as F1-score. Additionally, charts and figures generated from these results are included in the paper, but not stored in the GitHub repository.
